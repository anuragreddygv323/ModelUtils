# ModelUtils
A set of model utility Classes and functions in python to help with Kaggle comps

## Files:
`binary_stacking_classifier.py` - Provides a class to facilitate binary model stacking with sklearn like API for pandas dataframes.
`binary_stacking_np.py` - Provides a class to facilitate binary model stacking with numpy arrays. (Needs to be updated for new sklearn Kfold
`bayes_encode.py` - Provides a function to create n-level encodings of categorical variables

`regression_stacker.py` - Provides a class to facilitate regression model stacking with sklearn like API for pandas dataframes.

## Updates
Need to create a wrapper class on the classification and regression stackers to handle pandas and numpy arrays with a cleaner interface
